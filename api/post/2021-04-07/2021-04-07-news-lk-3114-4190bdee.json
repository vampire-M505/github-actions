Or is he still in Sri Lanka with an alias?However, there are serious concerns now as to why in 2021, an Indian national made his way alone to Kuliyapitiya to allegedly cause damage to Buddhist statues.Latest News Price of Brown Sugar reduced by Rs. 10100,000 doses of Sputnik-V COVID-19 jabs to SL next week2000 metric tonnes of paddy converted to rice released to marketJunior Hospital staff launch trade union action02 COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday (05); Fatalities rise to 588Share: "}
